         <h2 class="subheader">Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
         <p>Social media optimization (SMO) has changed how websites interact with its viewers. Before the rise of
            social media platforms, Search engine optimization (SEO) was how websites increase viewers to their site.
            Investopedia writes about the two types of optimizations as “have similar goals–to generate web traffic and
            increase awareness for a company's website”. SEO focuses on a website's content designed to appear in top
            search results, while SMO focuses on how to get people to interact with the content. To better understand
            how SMO and SEO can work for your (or a friend’s) website, let's see how websites optimize for search
            engines. </p>

         <p>There are a couple of methods websites use to increase their rankings on search results. Take advantage of
            the heading block by writing unique meta tags titles within every page (Designer Websites). Search engines
            look through meta tags to understand what the webpage is about, by keeping meta tags unique for each page,
            the website is more likely to rank higher in search results (Patel). Be sure your site is user-friendly and
            can load in under 3 seconds. Neil Patel, who runs a marketing firm specializing in SEO, writes “If your load
            time is more than 2 seconds, which is the standard load time for sites, then you should take steps to
            improve it”. Think of a time you walked in a restaurant where workers did not acknowledge you immediately.
            Was the experience a good impression? Another method is to link to reputable websites (Designer Websites).
            Think of links as referrals. If your website links to reputable websites, search engines take that into
            consideration when ranking your website.</p>

         <p>Social media optimization focuses on how users engage with the website on social media platforms.</p>

            <img src="images/social-buttons300w.png" title="Source: Warfare Plugins"
               alt="Image of social media buttons">
         </div>
         <p>Have you ever shared an article on your social media account with the push of a button? Implementing
            easy-to-use share buttons make sharing information a painless experience. </p>

         <p>Or have you found links to social media on your google search results? Social media engagement (interacting
            with users through social media) signals Google algorithm to rank your site higher in their search results
            (Roth).</p>

         <p>What about getting social media results based on your location? Jason Pantana, a social media strategist,
            stresses the importance of location tagging posts on social media platforms. </p>

         <p>Social media platforms provide marketing opportunities for websites to take advantage and gain exposure. In
            the following video, Jason Pantana provides 20 ways to optimize every social media post:</p>

         <p>How has social media platforms become a market force that is too big to ignore? While reading Social
            intelligence by Daniel Goleman, I learned about the power of mirror neurons. The book goes into how humans
            use mirror neurons throughout the brain, to learn survival skills by observing others. Our mirror neurons
            activate whenever we see a human emote on social media. Social media platforms allow humans to share their
            experiences and knowledge with ease. If you want your (or friend’s) website to be part of that experience,
            social media optimization is essential. </p>
