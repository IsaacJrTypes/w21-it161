       <p>I grew up in the Federal way area but call Seattle my home. My parents, migrating from Mexico, opened their restaurant to create a better future. Since my parents could not speak English, I navigated helping my parents get their first business license. I used what I learned from my middle school computer class to help design their restaurant menus. The restaurant industry has been a huge part of my life as Iâ€™ve met a lot of hard&#8209;working people, but after re&#8209;evaluating my goals, I am pursuing web development.</p>
       <p>Technology and the internet have always fascinated me. Growing up, I used to take my computer apart because I was curious how computer components worked. During my lunch breaks in high school, I would read online forums to customize my Firefox browser. Being able to grow up when the internet was taking off, I am thankful to see how the internet has decentralized information. From learning how to develop an exercise routine to learning how to trade stocks, knowledge is accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</p>
       <p>My favorite hobbies are reading non-fiction books, watching movies, and listening to many types of music (except country music).</p>
       <p>My goals are to learn web development, work in a foreign country, and learn how to draw.</p>
