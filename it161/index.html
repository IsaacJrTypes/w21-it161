       <p>I grew up in the Federal way area, but call Seattle my home. My parents, migrating from Mexico, opened their own restaurant to create a better future. Since my parents could not speak English, I helped them navigate getting their first business license to designing their restaurant menus at a very young age. The restaurant industry has been a huge part of my life as I’ve met a lot of hard-working people, but after re-evaluation&nbsp; my goals, I am interested in learning about web development.</p>
       <p>Technology and the internet have always fascinated me. I used to take my computer apart because I was curious how the computer components worked. During my lunch breaks in high school, I would read online forums to learn how to customize my Firefox browser. Being able to grow up at a time when the internet was taking off, I am thankful to see how the internet has decentralized knowledge. If you want to learn how to develop an exercise routine to learning how to trade stocks, knowledge with the help of technology is limited to one’s curiosity.</p>
       <p>My favorite hobbies are reading non-fiction books, watching movies, and listening to all types of music (except country music).</p>
       <p>My goals are to learn web development, work in a foreign country and learn how to draw.</p>
